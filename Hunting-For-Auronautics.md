# Create Auronatics
Many people have searched for it, none has it. And i believe that just akin to the one piece, When its available it will no longer be legendary.

*bruh that was cringe(its over).*

anyways so as to say it simple, i want it. Even though valkerien skies basically does the same thing, there is something about not being able to try it. It was the same for S&Box and itll be the same Auronaitics.



My hunt started at the website, trying to scavande it for details yeilds no results. There is a \download link, but it just redirects you to never gonna give you up. But try to enter a wrong url in and youll be linked to github.

Github provides a service where theyll host a simple website, but since github also hosts source codes for every open source application out there, this includes auronautics whenever it releases. Its possible to find the source code for the website, unfortunately this yelds nothing.



## wayback machine

sitting in my chair, i beggan to wonder. **what if the wayback machine saved the source code before it was privated?**

and amazingly this does in fact work. By using the wayback machine on ryanhcode's github page, we can reveale 2 pages which no longer exist. after posting some of my findings on the discord though, i got confirmation that they are not even under the same person anymore.

## the hunt is a long one

onfurtunately this is where my leads and guesses stop. And what is left, is little more than hope itll release soon.
