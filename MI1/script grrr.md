AAAA

### its so over

i forgor to record the start

as you can see we have storage, infinite ores, and electric machines. *10/10 shi jing ping certified*.

wait, what is that!?!?!? EBF *tiktok edit*

then after grinding for many more hours, i made a electric miner which allows me to fully automate drills

the ebf also allow me to do silisium processing

then i started with some higher tier machines, some of which allows me to do cool stuff(i have to go to records to see what)

what if i electrolise water, but remove use one for hydrogen and oxygen each.

polyethylne is the thing i was missing for speed upgrades which lets machines work faster.
